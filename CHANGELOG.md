# Changelog

What changed in the desk kit, newest first. Update a project with `node bin/kit.mjs <project>`.

### Desks can listen for their own mail (PRD 01) · New
- Give a desk its own addresses with a `Mail:` line in its `desk.md`. Then
  `node desks/desk.mjs watch <desk>` waits for mail to those addresses, prints one line per
  email and exits, so the session that started it wakes up and answers.
- It never shows an email twice, picks up mail another desk handed over, and lets only one
  person listen to a desk at a time (`take listen:<desk>` hands it over).
- `doctor` checks that no two desks claim the same address and that the mail Worker answers.
- Try it: add `Mail:` to a desk, set `DESK_MAIL_URL` and `DESK_MAIL_TOKEN` in `desks/.env`,
  then run `node desks/desk.mjs watch <desk>`.
